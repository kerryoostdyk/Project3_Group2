# Project3_Group2

Our project addressed UFO sightings around the world.  This led to three major questions.  We first wanted to determine if there are any trends in the reports over time.  In addition, we wanted to see what areas of the world reported the most sightings.  Finally, we decided to analyze the duration of the encounters in relation to the time of day the incidents occurred.

Our project explores a dataset of UFO sightings reported from around the world.  We are aiming to identify patterns and trends from these encounters through a web application.  We are using SQLite as the database, Flask for the back-end, JavaScript with Plotly for data visualization, and we wanted to provide an interactive platform to explore UFO sighting data.

We saw an increase in reported sightings in the late 1990s which continued to increase over time.  We saw most reported sightings were in the United States.  Finally, when looking at our overall data, there seems to be no correlation between the duration of the sightings and time of day.

Obviously, more recent data is needed.  There needs to be a standardized method of collecting and verifying this data.  In addition, there should be additional follow up with the observers as to what they saw and reported.
